# ATOM-SG Pilot - Kanban Board
*Last updated: 2026-04-21 11:30 SGT*

## 📢 NEW TOPIC STRUCTURE — GROUP TOPICS CREATED

4 group topics created for focused coordination:
- **Topic #51:** Deconstruction Pipeline — Vision LLM 3-layer (OCR + VLM + OpenCV)
- **Topic #52:** Baseline Generation — 4-question baseline test PDF
- **Topic #53:** Intervention — 10 days of teaching (data manipulation, nano-nodes, accurate visuals)
- **Topic #54:** QA & Testing — Persona testing, solvability, transfer test, ramp-up

**Coordination:** Sub-agents report to their assigned topic only, not directly to Sean

## ⚡ SYSTEM BLOCKER - RESOLVED

| # | Task | Owner | Blocker | Action Needed |
|---|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| S1 | OpenRouter model billing error | Zcaethbot | ✅ **Resolved** | Credit approved, model switched to GLM-4.7. Sub-agents operational. |
| S2 | Subagent timeout (problem generation) | Zcaethbot | ✅ **Resolved** | Chunked approach implemented (≤5 items per batch, explicit timeouts). |

## 🚫 BLOCKED - Internal Deconstruction Pipeline Required

| # | Task | Owner | Blocker | Action Needed |
|---|------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **W1** | **Weeks 2-4 Intervention (with exam-quality visuals)** | MvpBot | Internal deconstruction pipeline (D2-D7) | Blocked until internal deconstruction → reconstruction loop is implemented. Cannot use external markdown data. |
| **W2** | **Pathway Radar warm-up (with exam-quality visuals)** | Creative Bureau | Internal deconstruction pipeline (D2-D7) | Blocked until internal deconstruction → reconstruction loop is implemented. |
| **W3** | **Week 5/6 Transfer Test (with exam-quality visuals)** | Pedagogy Bureau | Internal deconstruction pipeline (D2-D7) | Blocked until internal deconstruction → reconstruction loop is implemented. |

*(All tasks blocked until internal deconstruction pipeline is operational.)*

### Next Milestone
- **Week 2 Pilot Launch:** 2026-04-26 ⚠️ **AT RISK** — Pending hands-on validation
- **Blockers:** Hands-on validation incomplete (significant issues found, fixes implemented but not verified)
- **Risks:** HIGH — Automated tests pass but real user experience unvalidated
- **Test Coverage:** 90 tests passing, but tests ≠ working product for users
